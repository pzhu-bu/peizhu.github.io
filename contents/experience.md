## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
- **Abama Capital Management Co., Ltd**
    - Jan 2024 - May 2024, Guangzhou - Base
    - Quantitative Researcher - Investment
    - **Research Focus**:
        - Explored and developed 71 factors. The large control ability factor was constructed through the three - distribution separation under the t - distribution to characterize investors' investment behavior characteristics in the market, resulting in a maximum long - short return of 53%.
        - Overflow factors and peak factors were developed from the perspective of financial behavior to characterize investors' trading behavior, with a maximum long - short return of 115%.
        - Quadratic variation jumps were analyzed from the perspective of stochastic integration, decomposing the jump characteristics of intraday returns. Under cumulative factor accumulation, a maximum long - short return of 62% was achieved.
        - Technical factors referred to Huatai Securities' "attention is all indeed" report. Fundamental data and intraday data were used to construct 43 feature factors for deep - learning lightweight models and large models for yield prediction. Under cumulative factor accumulation, a maximum long - short return of 96% was achieved.
    - **Strategy Construction**:
        - Mainly employed two types of models:
            - Econometric models: Technical factors were selected through forward and backward methods and weighted - combined using various models, resulting in a maximum cumulative long - short return of 45%.
            - Deep - learning multi - task learning models: Using 21 technical factors, 22 fundamental factors, and consensus expected factors as features, the models output returns for the past 21 days and past 11 days. Dynamic weighting was applied to calculate loss values. The maximum cumulative long - short return was 71% (44% after fees).
    - **Financial Forecasting Special Topic**:
        - Studied the characterization of GB2, BR3, BR12, and GAMMA - GAMMA functions on the distribution of intraday returns. Distribution forecasts were used for the remaining time of the day or the next day's returns and other relevant indicators. A maximum cumulative long - short return of 46% was achieved, with a drawdown of -6%.

## INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
- **ANXIN TRUST&INVESTMENT Co., Ltd**
    - Jan 2024 - Jan 2024, Beijing - Base
    - Fixed Income Quantitative Researcher - Capital Management
    - Integrated the SABR process into the standardized Libor market model framework, establishing the non - standardized SABR stochastic volatility Libor market model (SABR - LMM).
    - Conducted market calibration and simulation estimation of model parameters using interest rate cap options, interest rate swaption options, and the Metropolis - Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method.
    - Evaluated and compared the practical performance of the three types of Libor market models through empirical simulation calculations and comparative analysis. Research findings suggest that, based on simulated spread calculation results, for short - term Libor rate simulation, the SABR - LMM model with the addition of the SABR volatility term has smaller simulation errors compared to the LMM and Heston - LMM models, demonstrating better simulation performance.
    - Designed callable cumulative reverse floating rate floor options, incorporating the interest rate prediction results obtained through empirical simulation calculations into the calculation of issuance yields, achieving an annualized yield of 8.5%.
- **FCF Advisors**
    - Sep 2023 - Nov 2023, New York - Remote
    - Portfolio Implementation Analyst - Financial Engineering Department
    - Enhanced trading and execution practices to maximize transfer efficiency from model portfolio to actual investment.
    - Developed short - term trading models to enhance the market timing of active funds.
    - Provided short - term trading signals as a value - added service to clients.
    - Contributed to alternative alpha research and modeling, such as tax alpha and contextual alpha.
- **Sinolink Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division**
    - Sep 2023 - Dec 2023, Shanghai - Remote
    - Financial Engineering Analyst - Financial Engineering Research Group
    - Developed high - frequency factors from tick snapshot and trade - by - trade data. The highest slope convexity factor achieved excess returns of up to 9.8%.
    - Enhanced multi - factor risk prediction models, refining covariance matrices and idiosyncratic risk matrices using advanced techniques like Newey - West autocorrelation and eigenvalues. Achieved close alignment between predicted and actual volatility trends.
    - Optimized monthly portfolio weights to minimize expected risk, resulting in a significantly lower actual risk for the Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio compared to the benchmark and boosting the Sharpe ratio.
- **Fullgoal Fund Management Co., Ltd**
    - Jun 2023 - Aug 2023, Shanghai - Base
    - Financial Algorithm Engineer - Intern (Investment Research Group)
    - Utilized Google's pre - trained Tiny - Clue - Chinese model and fine - tuned it with jieba - scored texts. Then, text data from the Chaoyang Yongxu Database was input into the large model to calculate the probability of positive sentiment for each summary sentence of the report.
    - Applied negative adjustment, computed the adjusted sentiment score, and weighted it with a 90 - day rolling window to obtain the sentiment factor and its adjustment factor for each stock daily.
    - Research findings indicate that the adjustment factor better reflects the incremental information of the sentiment factor. A long - short portfolio constructed using this factor achieved a 35% return from 2016 to 2023.
    - Established an efficient enterprise - level financial data warehouse using Oracle, SQL, and other data tools. Implemented multithreading and multiprocessing principles in handling valuation and portfolio data insertion, along with a storage and insertion separation strategy.

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
- **Index - Enhanced Asset Portfolio Construction Using Random Forest**
    - Sep 2023 - Sep 2023
    - Preprocessed data from constituents of the CSI 500 Index, deriving 25 fundamental factors. These factors were standardized and industry - market neutralized to obtain new residual factor exposures. A Random Forest - based model was used for stock trade categorization (Buy, Sell, Hold), and daily trades were executed within an equally - weighted portfolio based on the CSI 500.
    - Factor importance scores showed that market capitalization factors had a significant influence on the Random Forest model. The model was sensitive to parameters, noise, and environmental changes, indicating that there was room to improve its generalization ability. Future research will focus on addressing these issues.
